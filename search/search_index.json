The air quality data is SILAM dataset from Finnish Meteorological Institute, providing global coverage at 20km resolution and five day forecast of seven air pollutants (Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), Particulate Matters &lt; 10 microns (PM10), Particulate Matters &lt; 2.5 microns (PM25), and Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>).</p> <p>Exposure to air pollution affects everyone. WHO estimates that 7 million people die every year from air pollution. While we are not able to directly affect the causes of air pollution, we hope to make it easy for everyone to access and understand the level of air pollutants where they are located.</p>"},{"location":"2021/11/26/atmospheric-moisture/","title":"Atmospheric Moisture","text":"<p>An increase in air temperature leads to an increase in evaporation as warmer air is able to hold more moisture. Incredibly, this means that since 1950, there is more moisture in the atmosphere to the tune of about 2kg or 2 litres per every square metre of earth's surface. The total volume of water that has been evaporated is equivalent to twice the volume of Lake Erie - in other words, climate change has essentially boiled of Lake Erie twice over.</p> <p>What does this mean? This means more humid summers and more likelihood of increasing heat index above danger levels. A particularly concern point is when the wet-bulb temperature rises above [TBD] degrees, which is the point at which we will not be able to maintain our temperature by sweating.</p>"},{"location":"2022/05/27/climate-change/","title":"Climate Change","text":"<p>For those of us keeping up with climate change related news, there are some numbers that have become familiar. For instance, we know that we should strive to limit global mean temperature to 1.5 deg C.</p> <p>On the other hand, while many of us feel like things are warmer than when we were little, finding this information is not that trivial. Complicating this is the fact that global warming happens unevenly so everyone's experience may differ.</p> <p>Fortunately, we have access to high-quality data published by ECMWF, where one can look up the history for any location from 1940 with ease. The dataset (ERA5) is created by combining all available sources of observation data, such as weather station and satellite, using a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction (NWP) model to estimate the state of the atmosphere.</p> <p>From the data, we can see that Singapore has experienced about 1 deg C of warming. This might not seem much, but this is equivalent to an increase in cooling energy demand by almost 20%, based on the concept of Cooling Degree Days (CDD). </p> <p>Hong Kong, also known for its hot climate, has warmed by about 1.5 deg C already:</p> <p>Find more locations using our Climate Explorer App</p>"},{"location":"2021/11/07/climate-change-and-heat-index/","title":"Climate Change and Heat Index","text":"<p>We often hear about the temperature increases caused by climate change. However, what we perceive as heat or cold is also affected by the amount of humidity in the air because evaporation through skin plays a large part of how we regulate our internal thermal equilibrium.</p> <p>When we look at how this has changed in the past 70 years, we can see how drastic the changes have been. The National Weather Service (NWS) defines heat index with four levels of severity, from caution to extreme danger, as shown in the chart below.</p> <p>For many cities, the number of hours of heat index in the 'Danger' or 'Extreme Danger' has doubled or tripled since 1950.</p>"},{"location":"2021/11/17/historical-weather/","title":"Historical Weather","text":"<p>Every year, the climate records are being broken and the hottest years are always within the last several years, which is a sign that we're in the midst of profound shift. Traditionally, we have defined climate as the average weather for a 30 year period, with the latest period of 1991-2020 considered as the period of new norm by NOAA.</p> <p>However, the rapid pace of change means that this period may be too long to be considered 'norm'. For instance, we can see in the chart below the disappearance of White Christmas, with decreasing average snow depth by almost 50% over the last 30 years.</p>"}]}
