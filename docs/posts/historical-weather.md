# Historical Weather

Every year, the climate records are being broken and the hottest years are always within the last several years, which is a sign that we're in the midst of profound shift. Traditionally, we have defined climate as the average weather for a 30 year period, with the latest period of 1991-2020 considered as the period of new norm by NOAA.

However, the rapid pace of change means that this period may be too long to be considered 'norm'. For instance, we can see in the chart below the disappearance of White Christmas, with decreasing average snow depth by almost 50% over the last 30 years.
