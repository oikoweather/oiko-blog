# Global Air Quality Data 

We're happy to be providing air quality data, available to all plans. The air quality data is [SILAM dataset](https://tdb.com) from [Finnish Meteorological Institute](https://fmi.org), providing global coverage at 20km resolution and five day forecast of seven air pollutants (Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), Particulate Matters < 10 microns (PM10), Particulate Matters < 2.5 microns (PM25), and Sulfur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>).

Exposure to air pollution affects everyone. WHO estimates that 7 million people die every year from air pollution. While we are not able to directly affect the causes of air pollution, we hope to make it easy for everyone to access and understand the level of air pollutants where they are located.
